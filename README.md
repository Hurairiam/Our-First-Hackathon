# 🚀 Sync4U – Smart Campus Connectivity App  
*A Hackathon Project, CSE Fest 2025, ULAB*

## 📅 Event Background

This project was developed during the **CSE Fest 2025 Hackathon**, hosted by the **Department of CSE at ULAB**. The event featured renowned IT entrepreneurs, a panel discussion, and an award ceremony.

Our team, **Bamboo Warriors** — made up of:

- [Abu Huraira](https://github.com/Hurairiam)  
- [Sadman Sakib](https://github.com/Raeden-Dev)  
- [Saif Hasan Khan](https://github.com/saifhasankhan197-hub)  

(*All in our 2nd semester!*) — took part in the challenge to build a solution that makes ULAB a "Smart Campus."

The hackathon timeline was intense:
- ⏱️ **8:30 AM – Hackathon started**
- 🧠 **8:30 AM –10:00 AM – Brainstorming (offline, no internet)**  
   - We built a poster identifying our problem and proposed solution  
- 💻 **10:00 AM –12:00 PM – AI-powered prototyping using Loveable.ai + ChatGPT**  
   - We designed the app, crafted prompts, and built a prototype with no actual code

## 🧠 Poster Submission

We created a poster to explain our problem statement and proposed solution:

## 🏆 Outcome

Out of all the teams:
- We made it to the **Top 9 Finalists** 🎉  
- **Did not place in Top 3** — mainly because we didn't submit working code  
- Our idea received high praise for practicality and innovation  
- **Saif Hasan Khan's presentation** was considered one of the best overall  

Despite not winning, this was a powerful first experience in ideation, collaboration, and rapid prototyping.
